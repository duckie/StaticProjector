This software is in development and cannot be used for the moment.

#### Lighweight CMS for geek people needing data freedom and extreme simplicity ####

StaticProjector is a CMS, but if you are lookin for a CMS with shiny themes, dozens on admin panels and plugins, this is the wrong place. StaticProjector is for simple websites you have to create in a hurry and which does not need a so much powerful engine but still need advanced customization about details.

StaticProjector is a file-based CMS, which means the administration interface is file edition through FTP, SFTP or SSH, or any method that fits your need. StaticProjector is for advanced users only.

What StaticProjector brings to you:
* High-performance: lighweight code with cache systems
* No database
* Easy host change: since the system is file based, the only thing you have to do is copying the files
* Security: no session model and no admin panels means less security flaw. Plus, the CMS do no write anything into your data folder, so you can forbid the PHP runtime to write into it.

What StaticProjector does not:
* Community website with user management, forums, comments
* Plugin system
* Ready-to-use template for your need
